A Certification Task Based on Data Science and Analytics Provided By British Airways

# British Airways Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
* Overview
Welcome to my GitHub profile! In this repository, you will find the code and documentation for two data science tasks I completed at British Airways. The tasks involve analyzing customer feedback and predicting customer buying behavior using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

* Task 1: Customer Feedback Analysis
In this task, I collected customer feedback from the web by scraping reviews specifically about British Airways from a website called Skytrax. I cleaned the data and performed an analysis to uncover insights. Some of the techniques I used include topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds. The Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository guides you through the data collection and analysis process. You can find the dataset in the "data" folder.

To summarize my findings, I created a PowerPoint slide using the template provided. The slide includes visualizations and metrics that highlight the key points from the analysis. It provides valuable insights into customer sentiments, topics of concern, and areas of improvement for British Airways.

* Task 2: Predictive Modeling of Customer Buying Behavior
In this task, I manipulated and prepared the provided customer booking data to build a predictive model. The goal was to predict whether a customer would make a booking for flights or holidays. I explored the dataset using the "Getting Started" Jupyter Notebook and created new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

I trained a machine learning model, specifically a RandomForest algorithm, to predict customer booking behavior. The model's performance was evaluated using cross-validation and appropriate evaluation metrics. Additionally, I visualized how each variable contributed to the predictive power of the model.

To present my findings, I created a summary slide using the PowerPoint/PDF template provided. The slide highlights the model's performance, important variables, and their contributions to the predictive power. It provides insights into customer behavior and can guide strategic decisions to acquire customers effectively.
